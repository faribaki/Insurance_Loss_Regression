# Insurance_Loss_Regression
In this project, we use the CatBoostRegressor model to predict insurance loss payments based on various features of any accident. To ensure confidentiality and protect sensitive information, the data is anonymized before use. During the preprocessing stage, regular expressions are employed to discover patterns within the anonymized data, which are then used as features for the model.

The target variable, representing the loss payment, follows an exponential distribution. To normalize the target, we apply a log transformation, making the target distribution more suitable for regression modeling. The data is split into training and testing sets using a default 75%-25% ratio. The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. Since the target was log-transformed, the predicted values need to be inverse-transformed back to the original scale before calculating the real MAE. This ensures that the MAE is computed on the real scale of the loss payments. However, here the estimated MAE is computed on the log-transformed scale, not on the real scale of the loss payments.

To speed up processing, GPU acceleration is utilized, enabling faster computation. CatBoost, a gradient boosting library, is chosen for its efficiency in handling categorical features and delivering high predictive accuracy in regression tasks.
